# Exercise 1 - Development and Evaluation of a Supervised Model

## Instructions
1. **Programatically** download 'loan_data.zip' file from the location below, then extract and read the ‘loan_data.csv’ file that it contains. **.zip file location: https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/example.data/loan_data.zip**
3. Using the “loan_status” variable as the outcome and spliting the data into train and test sets, use the other variables to develop the most appropriate type of classification model with the train dataset that predicts whether the `loan_status` should be “Charged Off” or “Fully Paid” on the test dataset. 
4. Exploratory analysis, model development, and model performance metric(s) are left to the discretion of the applicant.
5. Email your finalized, completely reproducible script as an attachment to L.A. Care's Talent Acquisition Specialist, Jamessa Jones, at jjones@lacare.org. The title of the script should be `lacare_ex1_<your name>_<yyyymmdd>.<r or py>` and should be submitted with your script for [exercise 2](https://github.com/lacare-exercises/data_scientist_interview/tree/master/exercise2).

## Assessment
The script developed by the applicant will be assessesd for:
- Reproducibility
- Code commenting and formatting
- Data pre-processing
- Model selection and development
- Interpretation of model performance
